# Cache Performance Analysis Engine

A low-level cache simulator built in C++ that models how memory access patterns
interact with CPU cache behavior — built to answer one question: why does the 
same data access run at wildly different speeds depending on how it touches memory.

---

## What it does

- Simulates a direct-mapped cache with configurable size and block size
- Decomposes memory addresses into tag, index, and offset
- Detects cache hits and misses on every memory access
- Classifies every miss as either **compulsory** or **conflict**
- Reports hit rate, total accesses, hits, and misses

---

## Why cache performance matters

Cache is the small, fast memory sitting between your CPU and RAM. Every time
the CPU needs data, it checks the cache first. A hit means instant access.
A miss means a trip to RAM — which can be 100x slower. The hit rate is the 
single number that determines how fast your program actually runs.

## Miss Classification

| Miss Type | Cause | Avoidable? |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Compulsory | First time this memory block has ever been accessed | No |
| Conflict | Block was cached before but got evicted by another address mapping to the same slot | Yes |

## Build and Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp cache.cpp -o cache && ./cache
```

Address 0x0 -> MISS

Address 0x20 -> MISS

Address 0x40 -> MISS

Address 0x60 -> MISS

Address 0x80 -> MISS
